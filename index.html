    <h1>Andy Agulue</h1>

    <body>

     <p>My name is Andy Agulue, I was born and raised in Nigeria, an I love going on adventures with my pup Symba, photography and riding motorcycles. I've lived in 5 states and thoroughly enjoy exploring places and peoples.</p>
     <p>I attended some college, but decided to take a break for a bit and learn from life. I've since worked in the restaurant industry and discovered my love for food and process, ran a few restaurants and helped a few friends open some. I've also worked as a cultivator in the Cannabis industry and 
        Pursued little bit of photography and video work both in front and behind the camera.</p>
     <p>I hope to learn skills to become a software developer to facilitate any desire to keep learning and exploring. </p>
